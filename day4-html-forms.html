                   <p>I've been diving into HTML forms again - both as a refresher for this blog and also to gain a deeper understanding before I move forward. And honestly, there's so much more to them than I intially thought. What started as a simple way to collect user input has turned into this fascinating study of user experience, accessibility, and web standards.</p>

                    <h2>My Journey with Form Basics</h2>
                    <p>When I first started working with forms, I thought they were just about throwing some input fields into a <span id="html-tag">&lt;form&gt;</span> tag and calling it a day. Boy, was I so wrong! I learned that every form needs two crucial attributes that I didn't quite use to fully understand:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span id="html-tag">action</span>: Tells the browser where to send the data</li>
                            <li><span id="html-tag">method</span>: Determines how the data gets there</li>
                        </ul>
                    <div class="html-example">
                        <code class="html-tag-example">
                            &lt;form action="submit.html" method="GET"&gt;<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;<span id="comment-tag">&lt;!-- All form information goes here --&gt;</span><br>
                            &lt;/form&gt;
                        </code>
                    </div>
                    <p>I used to just copy-paste this without really understanding what <span id="html-tag">POST</span> and <span id="html-tag">GET</span> means, but now I get it! (Thanks to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNcJuPIZ2WE" target="_blank">video tutorial</a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified" target="_blank">Web Dev Simplified.</a>)</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span id="html-tag">POST</span>: Useful for when you have a server where you need to save some information</li>
                            <li><span id="html-tag">GET</span>: Sends the collected information to another page on your site</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2>The Input Types That Changed Everything</h2>
                    <p>When I used to fill in forms online, I used to think that they were all just text field boxes. But now that I've learned about HTML forms, I've come to realized that it's more than that.</p>
                        <div class="html-example">
                            <div>
                            <label for="email">Email:</label>
                            <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="your@gmail.com"><br>
                            <code class="html-example-tag">
                                &lt;input type="email" name="email" placeholder="your@gmail.com"&gt;</code>
                                <p>The email input automatically valids email format, which would require the person to enter a valid email address before the form can be submitted.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                            <label for="password">Password:</label>
                            <input type="password" name="password"><br>
                            <code class="html-example-tag">
                                &lt;input type="password" name="password"&gt;</code>
                                <p>This is a password input, which hides the characters you type in the field box.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                            <label for="phone">Phone:</label>
                            <input type="tel" name="phone"><br>
                            <code class="html-example-tag">
                                &lt;input type="tel" name="phone"&gt;</code>
                                <p>The tel input requests for you to enter your phone number, and it also brings up the number and automatically on mobile devices.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>These small details make such a huge difference in the user experience, and I'm so glad that I know about them now!</p>
                        <p>There are also other input types that feel like Christmas mornings. Date pickers, color selectors, rang sliders - all built right into the browser!</p>
                            <div class="html-example">
                                    <div>

                    <h2>Tomorrow's Goals</h2>
                    <p>That's all for today! I'm gonna dive into other attributes of the form tomorrow:</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>If you're reading this and you're in a similar place - stuck between learning and doing, or terrified of starting - maybe we can figure this out together. And if you're already a developer who someone found this mess of a beginner's blog, I'd be incredibly grateful for any encouragement or advice you're willing to share.</p>
