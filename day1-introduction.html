            <!-- What I've Been Doing -->
            <section class="what-ive-been-doing">
                <h2>What I've Been Doing</h2>
                <p>For the past few weeks, I've been diving into HTML and CSS through <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a> and <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>. On paper, it looked like I was making progress. I learned about:
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML Tags</li>
                        <li>HTML Forms</li>
                        <li>HTML Tables</li>
                        <li>Semantic HTML</li>
                        <li>Basic CSS</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <!-- TODO: PUT IN IMAGES -->
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/notes-screenshot.jpg" alt="screenshot of my notes" width="400"/>
                </figure>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/cheatsheet-table.png" alt="screenshot of my cheatsheet"/ height="550"/>
                </figure>
                <p>I took detailed notes and even tried making a cheat sheet using HTML - just a simple table with columns for tags, descriptions, and examples. Nothing fancy, and honestly, I don't even think I did it right.</p>
                <p>Then I hit CSS positioning and flexbox, and everything fell apart.</p>

            <!-- The Frustation -->
            <section class="the-frustration">
                <h2>The Frustration (And Tutorial Hell is Real!)</h2>
                <p>Here's what really got to me: I couldn't retain the information, and I couldn't understand what I was reading or watching. I'd watch a tutorial, nod along like I got it, then try to do something similar and just... stare at the screen completely lost.</p>
                <p>You know what's funny? I used to be skeptical when I heard YouTubers talk about <em>"Tutorial Hell"</em>. I thought, "How can learning too much be a bad thing?" But wow, it's absolutely <strong>real</strong>. I was stuck in this endless cycle of watching tutorial after tutorial, taking notes, feeling like I was making progress, but never actually <em>building</em> anything. I had become a professional tutorial watcher, not a coder.</p>
                <p>That's when I realized I'm a hands-on learner. Just reading and watching wasn't going to cut it for me. I needed to break out of Tutorial Hell and start getting my hands dirty with actual code.</p>

            <!-- Moment of Truth -->
            <section class="moment of truth">
                <h2>The Moment of Truth</h2>
                <p>The real wake-up call came when I asked myself:
                    <blockquote>
                        <strong>If someone asked me to build something right now, would I know where to begin?</strong>
                    </blockquote>
                </p>
                <p>The answer was a resounding no. I felt like I wasn't actually learning anything, just going through the motions. I had all these notes and my wonky HTML cheat sheet, but if I was tasked with building something - anything - I would be completely lost.</p>
                <p>Something had to change if I really wanted to succeed at this.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- The Pivot -->
            <section class="the-pivot">
                <h2>The Pivot</h2>
                <p>I started watching different YouTube channels - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RealChrisSean target="_blank">Chris Sean</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JeremiahPeoples" target="_blank">Jeremiah Peoples</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@rootstechnology" target="_blank">TJ (Roots Technology)</a>, and others.</p>
                <p>What struck me wasn't just their teaching style, but the fact that many of them had documented their own learning journeys. TJ even mentioned how documenting his journey helped him stay accountable, connect with other developers, and also managed to get a job offer because the company was impressed by his learning journey.</p>
                <p>That's when it clicked: I needed to do something similar.</p>
                <p>Not just for accountability (though I definitely need that in my self-teaching journey), but also because I'm genuinely intrigued by the idea of connecting with current developers and maybe finding mentors or friends along the way.</p>

            <!-- Starting This -->
            <section class="starting-this">
                <h2>Starting This Blog (And Being Terrified)</h2>
                <p>I'm going to be completely honest here - I'm absolutely terrified right now. I'm still lost, and I wouldn't even know if I'm doing any of this code wrong. My current approach is basically <em>"if it looks okay on the page, then it should be right,"</em> which I'm pretty sure it doesn't actually work that way.</p>
                <p>But here I am, building this blog as my first real attempt at applying what I've learned. It's just HTML pages right now - pretty boring, right? No fancy styling, no interactive elements, just plain old HTML that I'm not even sure I'm writing correctly.</p>
                <p>I've come to realize that perfecting HTML is crucial because it's the foundation of everything. The beautifying (CSS) and the playful interactions (JavaScript) will come later - assuming I don't mess this up completely.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- Going Forward -->
            <section class="going-forward">
                <h2>What This Means Going Forward</h2>
                <p>I'm changing my approach completely. Instead of trying to learn everything perfectly before I start building, I'm going to build while I learn. This blog will be my playground, my testing ground, and hopefully my way of connecting with people who can help guide me through this maze.</p>
                <p>Everyday, I'll document what I learned, what I struggled with, and what I actually built - no matter how small, imperfect, or potentially wrong it is.</p>
                <p>Because here's what I've learned on Day 1:
                    <blockquote>
                            <strong>I need to stop being afraid of making mistakes and start making them in public.</strong>
                    </blockquote>
                Maybe that's the only way I'll actually learn and grow as a developer.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- Tomorrow's Goals -->
            <section class="tomorrow-goals">
                <h2>Tomorrow's Goals</h2>
                    <ul class="goals">
                        <li>Watch tutorials and figure out how to use Git & GitHub</li>
                        <li>Stop overthinking and start doing</li>
                        <li>Hope that someone, somewhere, might stumble across this and either relate to my struggle or offer some guidance</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>If you're reading this and you're in a similar place - stuck between learning and doing, or terrified of starting - maybe we can figure this out together. And if you're already a developer who somehow found this mess of a beginner's blog, I'd be incredibly grateful for any encouragement or advice you're willing to share.</p>
