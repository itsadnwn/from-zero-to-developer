            <h3>Hi there!</h3>
            <p>I'm someone who's always loved building things with my hands. If you saw the amount of Lego sets I have, you'd probably think it's quite insane for a normal girl like me - but there's something incredibly satisfying about creating something from scratch, piece by piece.</p>
            <p>My professional journey has been... well, all over the place, honestly. I started as a graphic designer, focusing on branding and editorial work, where I got to bring visual ideas to life. Later, I became a cat groomer because, well, I absolutely <em>love</em> animals. Both experiences taught me different skills - creativity, attention to detail, patience, and working with my hands - but recently, I've been feeling completely lost and unsure about what comes next.</p>
            <p>It's scary being in your late twenties and feeling like you have no clear direction. I'm currently jobless, which adds another layer of uncertainty and, if I'm being honest, anxiety about the future. That's when I remembered something: I used to do a little bit of coding when I was younger, mainly tinkering around on platforms like Blogger. It wasn't serious or structured, but I enjoyed the problem-solving aspect of it.</p>
            <p>Now, I've decided to give coding another try - but this time, I want to learn it the proper way.</p>

            <h3>Why I'm Learning to Code</h3>
            <p>The idea of building something from scratch really appeals to me, and coding feels like the digital equivalent of my beloved Lego sets. I'm drawn to the hands-on nature of it and the possibility of creating resources that could genuinely help people and animals.</p>
            <p>I dream of building things like journaling apps, pet adoption platforms, or tools that support positive mental wellness - applications that could make a real difference in people's lives.</p>
            <p>Right now, I'm thinking about this as a career change, which is both exciting and terrifying. Some days I feel motivated and hopeful, other days I question whether I'm too old to start over or if I'm just fooling myself. This self-teaching journey is harder than I expected - there's no syllabus, no teacher to ask questions, and honestly, some days I have no idea if I'm learning the right things or just wasting time.</p>
            <p>But I'm trying to push through those doubts. No, I'm going to push through those doubts. Because I genuinely believe this could be something meaningful for me.</p>

            <h3>My Learning Journey</h3>
            <p>I'm a visual learner who prefers structured approaches but also enjoys exploring on my own. I'm somewhere between a problem-solver and a creative type, and while I'm naturally introverted and like working alone, I'm also intrigued by the idea of being part of a learning community.</p>
            <p>This blog will document my journey from absolute zero to hopefully becoming a developer. I'll share what I learn each day, the challenges I face, resources I discover, and the small victories along the way.</p>
            <p>I'll also be honest about the days where I feel stuck, overwhelmed, or like I'm not making progress - because I think those moments are just as important to document.</p>
            <p>If you're on a similar path, I'd love to connect - maybe we can share resources, celebrate small wins together, or just remind each other that we're not alone in this. And if you're already a developer who stumbled across this, I'd be grateful for any encouragement or advice you're willing to share.</p>
