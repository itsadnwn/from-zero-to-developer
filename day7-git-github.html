                    <p>Man, I wish someone had explained Git and GitHub to me like this when I first started learning all of these weeks ago. I spent way too much time being confused about what these things actually do and why everyone kept saying they were "essential". Now that I finally get it, I want to share what I've learned. </p>
                    <p>Here are the two videos that have really helped me understood Git and GitHub:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ-qvsxPHpY" target="_blank">Git Tutorial for Dummies by Nick White</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XhxR9Vs6zc" target="_blank">How to Use GitHub Pages in 2025 by The Common Coder</a></li>

                <section class="command-line">
                    <h2>The Lightbulb Moment about Command Line</h2>
                    <p>I admit I avoided the command line for the past few weeks because it looked scary. All those black screens with white texts - it was all too confusing and it felt like hacker movie stuff. But then I was given this analogy that changed everything.</p>
                    <p>Think about ordering food. You know how some apps make you click through 50 different screens?</p>
                    <div class="command-line-example">
                        <p>Open the app → Browse menus → Click appetizers → Scroll through 20 options → Add to cart → Go back → Click entrees → Scroll through 30 more options → Add to cart → Checkout → Fill out forms → Submit</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>It's exhausting... Even typing that out, I'm exhausted already.</p>
                    <p>When I want to save my code to GitHub now, instead of clicking through VS Code's menus:</p>
                    <div class="command-line-example">
                        <p>Source Control → Click the + next to each file → Type message → Commit → Sync → Wait</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Now I just type:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>git add .</li>
                            <li>git commit -m 'what was done'</li>
                            <li>git push</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>And boom! Done in 3 seconds. The command line isn't trying to be intimidating. It's just the fastest way to tell your computer exactly what you want.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="what-git-is">
                    <h2>What Git Actually Is (And Why I Need It)</h2>
                    <p>I used to think Git was just for real programmers working on huge projects. Turns out, I needed it from day one and I will always need it. It's like my best friend now.</p>
                    <p>Git is like a time machine for your code. Every time I save my work <em>(called a 'commit')</em>, it takes a snapshot of everything. Broke my code? I can go back to yesterday's version in seconds. Want to try something risky? I can create a "branch" and experiment without breaking up my main code.</p>
                    <p>It's like having a safety net for my code. If I mess up, I can just roll back to the last working version. No more panicking about losing hours of work.</p>

                <section class="joining-github">
                    <h2>Why I Finally Joined GitHub</h2>
                    <p>I'll be honest - I was intimated by GitHub at first. It felt like this exclusive club where only real developers hung out. But I now realize that I was missing out on so much.</p>
                    <p>GitHub is basically social media for programmers, but <em>way</em> more useful than Instagram.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>It's my portfolio now.</strong> Okay, it's still empty now. But it'll be my portfolio for when I apply for jobs in future because employers would want to see my actual code. GitHub is where I can show what I can build. It's like a public workshop where people can see the quality of my work.</li>
                        <li><strong>It's where I learn.</strong> GitHub has millions of projects I can study. Found a cool website? The code is probably on GitHub and I can study it, learn from it, and try to create it on my own.</li>
                        <li><strong>It's my backup.</strong> I haven't had any disasters yet (knock on wood), and while I do save my files on Google Drive as well, it is nice to know that my code is safe in the cloud of GitHub. This is a peace of mind that every developer desires (I would like to think so because I'm not a developer yet and I already feel that way).</li>
                        <li><strong>It's where I can contribute.</strong> Even though right now I'm just contributing this self-learning journey blog and there's probably not much anyone can benefit from at this moment, I know that I will be able to contribute to better codes and projects in future as I progress.</li>
                    </ul>

                <section class="github-pages">
                    <h2>GitHub Pages: My Free Website (Wow!)</h2>
                    <p>I had no idea GitHub gives you free website hosting. Like, actually free. Every repository can become a live website. Here's how I learned to set it up:</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/github-pages-settings.png" width="600" alt="GitHub pages settings"/>
                    </figure>
                    <ol>
                        <li>I go to one of my repositories on GitHub, click on "Settings" at the top.</li>
                        <li>Scroll down to "Pages" in the sidebar.</li>
                        <li>Under "Source", I select "Deploy from a branch", and choose "master" as my branch.</li>
                        <li>Then click "Save".</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>That's it. GitHub gives me a URL and my blog now is live.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="my-honest-take">
                    <h2>My Honest Take</h2>
                    <p>I'm still <em>very</em> new to all these, and I'm sure there are still a lot for me to learn, but Git and GitHub don't feel like this huge mountain anymore. They're what let me actually feel like I'm taking a step closer to becoming a developer.</p>
                    <p>If you're in the same boat as me, <strong>just start.</strong> Make a GitHub account, learn Git. Create something simple and put it online. We'll figure out the rest as we go.</p>
                    <p>I'm learning that everyone starts somewhere, and the developers around the world were beginners once, too.</p>

                <section class="tomorrow-goals">
                    <h2>Tomorrow's Goals</h2>
                    <ul class="goals">
                        <li>Write and commit post on CSS Fundamentals</li>
                        <li>CSS Color Systems</li>
                        <li>CSS Box Model and Display</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you're reading this and you're in a similar place - stuck between learning and doing, or terrified of starting - maybe we can figure this out together. And if you're already a developer who someone found this mess of a beginner's blog, I'd be incredibly grateful for any encouragement or advice you're willing to share.</p>
